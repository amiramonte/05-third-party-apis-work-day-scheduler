## Description

This application is a work day scheduling tool. This allows you to save tasks and events to each time block of a standard work day using the local storage of your machine. 

This project was built to help me with the following:

  * local storage, both saving information to, and recalling information from
  * understand and use jQuery to dynamically update HTML and CSS
  * understanding and using the moment.js library


## Functionality

The following video demonstrates the application's functionality:
